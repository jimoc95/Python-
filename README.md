This repository contains all of the coursework completed during the course of my Programming & Problem Solving module which was a major part of my Higher Diploma in Computer Science at UCC.
During this module we were tasked with solving problems set by our lecturer each week using the python tools we had learned during the module such as tuples,lists, 
dictionaries, loops, recursion, list comprehension etc.

For the final lab of the year (Lab K) we had to come up with our own problem statement and solution and also provide a settings file which documented what outputs should be obtained from certain inputs.
For my problem I created a function to operate as a takeaway restaurant ordering system. Customers would select items from the menu file and input the item codes, quantities and their name and the function would calculate their total and then write that order to a file for the kitchen while also assigning each order to one of the six chefs in the kitchen to make sure that the workload was evenly divided.
